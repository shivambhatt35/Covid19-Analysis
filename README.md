# 🦠 COVID-19 Data Analysis & 🌍 World Happiness Report 2020 📊

This project explores the relationship between the global spread of COVID-19 and key socio-economic indicators using datasets from **Johns Hopkins University** and the **World Happiness Report 2020**. The goal is to understand how factors like GDP, social support, and health expectancy correlate with COVID-19 case trends across countries.

## 💡 Insights Gained

> “We found potential negative correlations between social support and COVID-19 cases, suggesting that countries with stronger social infrastructure experienced slightly slower case growth. GDP per capita also showed weak trends, while healthy life expectancy was more closely tied to lower case counts.”
